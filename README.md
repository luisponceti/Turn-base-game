#5.4-turn-based-game
* I partnered with a classmate to complete this project, which required us to create a turn-based game in the style of Pokemon or Final Fantasy. My partner and I created a western-themed game based on the NES classic Sunset Riders. The game utilizes JavaScript object constructors in order to "create" each character upon starting the game. Upon firing, the villain's health is decremented by a random number between 1 and 10 and the same then happens to the hero during the automatic counterattack. We also used Handlebars.js for templating and Underscore.js for iteration.
